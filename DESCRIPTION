SystemRequirements: fftw3 (>= 3.1.2), gsl
Description: Contains methods for creating multivariate
  interpolations of functions on a hypercube. If available through fftw3, the DCT-II/FFT
  is used to compute coefficients for a Chebyshev interpolation.
  Other interpolation methods for arbitrary Cartesian grids are also provided, a piecewise multilinear,
  and the Floater-Hormann barycenter method. For scattered data polyharmonic splines with a linear term
  is provided. The time-critical parts are written in C for speed. All interpolants are parallelized if
  used to evaluate more than one point.
