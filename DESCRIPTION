Description: Contains methods for creating multivariate Chebyshev
  interpolations of functions on a hypercube. If available through fftw3, the DCT-II/FFT
  is used to compute the coefficients, so it is reasonably fast. Some interpolation methods for
  multivariate non-Chebyshev grids are also provided, a multilinear, and the Floater-Hormann barycenter method,
  as well as polyharmonic splines with a linear term.
